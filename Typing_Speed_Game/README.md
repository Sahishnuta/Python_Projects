## Problem Statement

**Develop a Python application that measures and improves users' typing speed and accuracy through interactive timed tests.**

### Key Objectives:
1. **Measure Typing Performance**: Calculate both speed (Words Per Minute) and accuracy percentage in real-time
2. **Provide Timed Challenges**: Implement countdown-based typing tests with visual progress feedback
3. **Generate Random Content**: Use dynamic text generation to ensure test variety and prevent memorization
4. **Offer Immediate Feedback**: Show detailed results including errors, correct characters, and performance metrics
5. **Create Engaging UI**: Build an intuitive graphical interface with visual elements and animations

### Functional Requirements:
- Start tests with a visible countdown timer
- Display random text passages for typing practice
- Track user input in real-time with visual feedback
- Calculate WPM based on correct characters typed
- Compute accuracy percentage considering errors and corrections
- Highlight mistakes and show progress during typing
- Present comprehensive results after test completion
- Allow restarting tests without exiting the application

### Technical Specifications:
- Use **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface
- Implement **color-coded feedback** (green for correct, red for incorrect)
- Include **progress tracking** with visual indicators
- Support **space-aware word counting** for accurate WPM calculation
- Handle **special keys** (Backspace, Enter) appropriately
- Generate **varied text samples** for different test attempts

### Target Users:
- Individuals wanting to improve typing skills
- Students learning touch typing
- Professionals seeking to increase typing efficiency
- Anyone interested in benchmarking their typing speed

This application addresses the need for an accessible, user-friendly tool to practice and measure typing proficiency without requiring internet connectivity or external services.
