## Problem Statement

**Web Scraping Automation for E-commerce Product Data Extraction**

### Core Problem:
The project addresses the challenge of efficiently extracting structured product information from e-commerce websites (specifically Flipkart) without writing complex, site-specific scraping code for each new target website.

### Key Challenges Solved:

1. **Dynamic Content Handling**: E-commerce websites frequently update their layouts, CSS classes, and HTML structures, making traditional scraping methods brittle and requiring constant maintenance.

2. **Rapid Prototyping**: Instead of manually inspecting HTML elements and writing custom selectors for each data field, this solution automates the pattern recognition process.

3. **Multi-Product Data Extraction**: The need to scrape multiple product attributes (name, price, description, ratings, etc.) consistently across different product listings.

4. **Scalability**: Creating a reusable scraping model that can be applied to similar e-commerce sites with minimal modifications.

### Technical Problems Addressed:

- **Pattern Learning**: Automatically learning the HTML patterns for desired data fields based on provided examples
- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring extracted data maintains consistent formatting across multiple pages
- **Efficiency**: Reducing development time for web scraping tasks from hours to minutes
- **Maintenance**: Creating adaptable scrapers that can handle minor website layout changes

### Use Case Example:
A user wants to monitor prices and specifications of electronics products on Flipkart. Instead of:
- Manually inspecting HTML structure
- Writing XPath/CSS selectors
- Handling pagination manually
- Updating code when the website changes

They can simply provide example data and let AutoScraper learn the patterns automatically.

### Value Proposition:
This project demonstrates how to build intelligent web scrapers that can adapt to website changes and significantly reduce the time and effort required for data extraction tasks in e-commerce and similar structured web content scenarios.
