## Problem Statement

The project aims to **automate flight data extraction from Goibibo** to help travelers and researchers:

### Core Problem:
- **Manual flight search limitations**: Users need to repeatedly search for flights with different parameters
- **Data comparison challenges**: Difficult to compare multiple flights across different dates/routes efficiently
- **Time-consuming process**: Manual data collection is slow and prone to errors
- **Lack of structured data**: Flight information needs to be organized for analysis

### Solution Objectives:
1. **Automate flight data scraping** from Goibibo for specified routes and dates
2. **Extract comprehensive flight details** including prices, timings, airlines, and amenities
3. **Store data systematically** in CSV format for easy analysis
4. **Handle multiple search scenarios** (one-way, round trips, different dates)
5. **Provide flexible date range searching** for price trend analysis

## Key Features Implemented:

### 1. **Data Extraction**
- Flight numbers and airline names
- Departure and arrival times
- Flight duration and layover information
- Pricing details (base fare, taxes, total)
- Aircraft type and seat availability
- Amenities and baggage information

### 2. **Search Flexibility**
- Multiple origin-destination combinations
- Date range support for trend analysis
- Configurable number of adults/children
- Round trip and one-way options

### 3. **Data Management**
- CSV output with structured columns
- Error handling for failed requests
- Rate limiting to avoid being blocked
- Data validation and cleaning

## Technical Challenges Addressed:

1. **Dynamic Content Handling**: Goibibo uses JavaScript rendering
2. **Anti-bot Protection**: Implementing delays and realistic user behavior
3. **Data Parsing Complexity**: Extracting nested flight information
4. **Session Management**: Maintaining cookies and headers
5. **Rate Limiting**: Avoiding IP blocking while scraping

## Use Cases:

- **Price Comparison**: Find cheapest flights across dates
- **Travel Planning**: Analyze flight options for trip planning
- **Market Research**: Study airline pricing strategies
- **Personal Travel**: Automated flight searching for frequent travelers

The project essentially creates a **flight data aggregation tool** that bypasses manual search limitations and provides structured, analyzable flight information from Goibibo.
